# Philoscope

Philoscope is a magical mirror app for iOS that acts like a wizard, showing users how the objects in their prompts might appear in the future. When a user enters a simple prompt, Philoscope uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini to expand and refine it into a detailed description. This enhanced prompt is then sent to DALLÂ·E 3, which generates a 1024x1024 pixel image based on the description. Philoscope is built with SwiftUI and modern Swift concurrency to provide a smooth and interactive experience.
